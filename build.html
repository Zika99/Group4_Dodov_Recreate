                    <div>
                        <p class="web"> In 2019, I wanted to create a website that closely followed our custom design
                            and had smooth animations and interactions. I looked at<a> UIkit</a>, but I didn't pick it
                            for two reasons:</a></p>


                    </div>
                    <div class="hyp-div">
                        <p><span class="hyp">-</span> It had its own opinion on design</p>

                    </div>





                    <div class="lead">
                        <p class="">
                            This lead me to search for other frameworks that, unlike UIkit, provide just the basic
                            JavaScript functionality, allowing you to style and animate as you wish. I didn't find
                            anything. So, naturally, I decided to make <a>my own thing.</a>


                        </p>
                    </div>



                    <p class="devel">I was developing the framework in parallel with the website I was working on and it
                        was wonderful. I was able to make the code just right and implement just the features I need. I
                        took some inspiration from UIkit, but stuck to my
                        main idea.</p>
                    <p class="late">Later, I noticed that things weren't very efficient, so I decided to refactor. But
                        because I was developing that framework and simultaneously using it, I had to rework not only
                        the framework, but the website as well. Apart from that, I was trying to make this work for as
                        many use cases as I could. What if you use React? What if you don't? What if you use jQuery?
                        What if you don't even know JavaScript that much?</p>


                    <div class="">
                      
                        <p class="enth">At this point, my enthusiasm slowly started to fade away. Without realizing it, I had put
                            myself in a position where I wanted to solve problems that don't yet exist and solve them
                            perfectly. But I still believed that in the end, it'd be "worth it".</p>
                    </div>


                    <p class="point">Then, our team started to grow. I was no longer the only one working on that
                        website. Since it used my framework, I had to onboard new people with it. This meant that I had
                        to write up a README, then documentation, example usage, etc. Despite that, we still had to
                        clear up some stuff in Slack.
                    </p>




                    <p class="team">Because our team grew, so did our workload. This caused work on the framework in
                        parallel with the website to transition in work on the framework during the weekends and early
                        mornings.</p>

                    <p class="carry">I carried on, though. I had (and to this point, still have) the habit of abandoning
                        projects, so I was determined to at least boil the framework down to small organized JavaScript
                        snippets that you could download via npm. But do I use <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components/Using_custom_elements">Custom Elements</a> or even go simpler than
                        that and use just ES6 classes?
                    </p>




                    <p class="recent">Recently, I started getting more and more into the React ecosystem. Late to the
                        party, I know. I also started noticing more websites with
                   <code><span class="orange">__nuxt</span> or<span class="orange">___gatsby</span> </code> . So no matter how I build my framework, it wouldn't work
                        with the way most people build for the web. Since I want to start using these tools as well, my
                        framework won't work for me either.</p>
                        <p class="unrel">Unrelated to this, I had slowly started to pay more attention to my health and
                            well-being. I changed my eating and sleeping habits, started to exercise and stretch more, I
                            even started reading books… This made the weekends and early mornings much more packed and
                            valuable.</p>
                        <p class="team">And now I'm here. I had made something that nobody really uses, but still
                            represents a solid part of our workflow. What do I do? Well, I think I've learned some
                            lessons in the past 3 years.</p>


                        <h2 class="matter">Code Doesn't Matter</h2>


                        <p class="unless">Unless you're building software for aircraft or medical equipment, nobody
                            really cares about your code, and neither should you. Especially in web development. At the
                            end of the day, you want a bunch of boxes with text and images in them. You can have a
                            hellish codebase and still get the job done. A perfect codebase doesn't exist. At least not
                            for a very long time, in large projects, or with many people involved. Things will get messy
                            and you should be ready to accept that.</p>

                        <h2 class="maintain">Maintenance Is a Burden</h2>


                        <p class="doc">Let's say you've built something and it works perfectly. That won't last long.
                            Bugs will appear, new people will join and documentation will be needed, features will be
                            requested. Who's going to handle that? If you're doing this as a side project, are you
                            prepared to be distracted by these things while working? If not, are you prepared to do them
                            in your free time?</p>

                        <p class="point">Even if people start contributing with pull requests and taking some of that
                            load off of you, you'll still have to review and approve of what's going on.</p>

                        <h2 class="launch">Third-Party Is Fine</h2>



                        <p class="else">If you find someone else who has done the work for you, use it. There might be
                            things that you don't like,
                            but compared to the hidden costs of maintaining something yourself, they won't matter.
                            If that third-party code has been out for a long time, chances are that most common bugs and
                            edge cases
                            would have already been handled. Doing things yourself should be your last resort, because
                            you'll slowly
                            discover the same issues as well and waste time on solved problems.</p>

                        <h2 class="launch">Launch Early</h2>




                        <p class="off">On the off-chance that you really want or have to build something, launch it as
                            soon as you can. As David Heinemeier Hansson said on <a>episode "Launch Now" of the Rework
                                podcast:</a></p>

                        <div>
                            <pre>
            <code class="opac">
> If you're not uncomfortable by the time you're launching,
> it's way too late.
            </code>
            </pre>
                        </div>

                        <p class="never">I never really launched my side project. It wasn't "ready". At the same time,
                            it became a bigger and bigger dependency in our main projects. That's an issue, because
                            you're building on top of something that isn't validated by other people. If I had shared
                            it, maybe people would have helped out and given ideas for improvements. Or, maybe people
                            would have critiqued it and made me question whether it's valuable.</p>
                        <p class="most">And that's what I was most afraid of — that the project isn't valuable. But no
                            matter how much effort you put into something, you still can't know for sure if it's
                            valuable until other people give their own points of view. That's why it's better to launch
                            as soon as possible:</p>


                        <p class="value"><span class="hyp">-</span> If you've built something valuable, you'll get more like-  
                            
                                 minded people to help you out with
                            it</p>
                        <p class="sth"><span class="hyp">-</span> If you've built something pointless, you'll save time and probably learn about new and
                            better approaches</p>

                        <h2 class="conc">Conclusion</h2>



                        <p class="archive">I will archive my project. These problems have already been solved by many people, many
                            times.
                            We all know that <a href="https://dayssincelastjavascriptframework.com/">every day, a new JavaScript framework is born.</a> This happens because
                            people like me
                            think they've got the silver bullet and can solve a certain problem once and for all.
                            But that's impossible and delusional. It's like that <a href="https://xkcd.com/927/">xkcd comic about standards:</a></p>
                        <img class="stan" src="img/standards.png" style="width:625px; height:400px;">



                        <p class="work">We should work on solving new problems, not existing ones. If you find an issue
                            with someone else's code, report it or directly submit a pull request and fix it. Not just
                            for yourself, but for everybody else! Your contributions will be nicely welcomed! Don't
                            create something new with its own set of problems.</p>

                        <p class="imp">It's impossible to build something entirely by yourself. At some point, your
                            "pristine" code will


                            have to interact with other people's "messy" code. Sure, you might not use third-party code
                            on your website,
                            but its existence still depends on it. The operating system it runs on is not built by you.
                            The browser that your viewers use to see it is not built by you. The protocols that carry
                            your data across
                            the wire are not designed by you.</p>

                        <p class="point"> You will always depend on other people's work. Embrace that!
                        </p>
